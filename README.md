## Overview
The **Admin Management Module** is a central part of the **microservices architecture** and is responsible for handling administrative operations, such as:
- User role assignment
- System configurations
- Monitoring system performance
- Managing various components within the microservices ecosystem

This module interacts with other services (like User Profile, Authentication, and Analytics) within the microservices architecture to ensure the smooth administration of the application. It provides an interface for managing and configuring various system settings and operational workflows across different microservices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that **Docker** is installed (if the microservices are containerized).
- The Admin module requires access to the **centralized database** and **shared services** within the microservices architecture.
- Ensure that **environment variables** are set correctly for each microservice to function.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the Docker images for the microservices or use Docker Compose if applicable.
3. Configure environment variables (such as database connections, API keys, etc.) in the `.env` file or the system's environment.
4. Deploy the Admin module and associated microservices (e.g., User Profile, Authentication, Analytics) as part of the microservices ecosystem.
